go-toys
=======

Variety of silly stuff I need to verify before I do certain optimizations in real code. Some of them confirm known things about "how computers work," others bring some light to particular way go stdlib and runtime features. There is also random stuff that fits nowhere but to "toys".

See directories and code there for explanations. Public domain work unless specified otherwise inside of the directory level README.
